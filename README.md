A recreation of a standard business website landing page created with HTML and CSS skills.
A heavy emphasis on recently learned skills I have gained recently such as Flexbox. 

The goal of this project was to create a landing page template for a website, and my personalization
of the website resulted in the creation of a Geology themed company home page. Now complete, I 
have learned throughout the course of this project how to use Flexbox to arrange the fundamentals of a web page.
